For each badge, implement a progress indicator showing how close the player is to earning it. Indicators should include:

1. Progress bar (e.g., [█████░░░] 60%)

2. Counter / live number (e.g., 15/20 words, 37/40 WPM, Accuracy 93/95%)

3. Color change or alert when progress is near completion (80–99% → yellow and message 'Almost there!')

4. Reset indicator if the badge requirement is not met (e.g., mistake → ❌ Mistake! Progress Reset)

Add an ‘Achievements’ button at the bottom of the game screen, next to a sentence like 'View your progress'. Clicking this button opens a panel showing all badge progress indicators for all modes.

The system should update automatically while the player types and provides live visual and text feedback.

Output: Code or pseudo-code ready to integrate into the game, including badge progress, alerts, colors, and reset logic."
